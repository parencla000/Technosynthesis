### Ada Lovelace

Ada Lovelace was one of the world's first computer scientists and computer programmers. She was born on December 10th, 1815, and died on Novermber 27th, 1852. During the era in which she lived, there were no electronic general-purpose computers. However, Charles Babbage had designed a hypothetical mechanical "Analytical Engine" which would have functioned as a large and slow but functional mechanical computer using a complex system of gears. It was never built. The Analytical Engine as designed had approximately 16.2 kilobites of memory in modern units, and could have been programmable with punched cards. Lovelace contributed to this machine as a mathematician by writing several computer programs, detailling the capabilities of this machine in her notes, and was the first to speculate that general-purpose computers could have other applications beyond mathematics, such as composing music. Lovelace lived in England for most of her life. 

### Charles Babbage

Charles Babbage was the first person to design a general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine, and is currently considered the "father of computers" in some respects. Babbage was born on December 26th, 1791 in London, and died on October 18th 1871 in London, where he lived for most of his life. Before he designed the Analytical Engine, Babbage designed a few other mechanical machines to perform similar feats of computation, such as the Difference Engine, but these devices were not programmable general-purpose computers like the Analytical Engine. While the Analytical Engine has never been built, Babbage's Difference Engine was built in 1991 by a British museum and could have been built in Babbage's time if funding had been provided.
